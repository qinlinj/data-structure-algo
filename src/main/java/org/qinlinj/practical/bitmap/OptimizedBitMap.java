/**
 * Optimized BitMap Implementation
 * <p>
 * This implementation improves upon the original BitMap by:
 * 1. Using a long[] array to support a much larger range of integers
 * 2. Adding methods for clearing bits and checking if bits are set
 * 3. Providing efficient bit counting and range operations
 * 4. Implementing proper toString() for better visualization
 * 5. Adding methods for bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) between bitmaps
