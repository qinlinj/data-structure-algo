/**
 * Dynamic Programming: Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This class demonstrates the bottom-up (iterative) approach to dynamic programming,
 * which is often more intuitive and efficient than recursive approaches.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * 1. Bottom-up DP builds solutions starting from the simplest subproblems (base cases)
 * 2. Solutions are stored in a "DP table" and built up iteratively
 * 3. This approach eliminates the need for recursion and its associated overhead
 * 4. The DP table in bottom-up approach is equivalent to the memo array in top-down approach
 *
 * Advantages of bottom-up over top-down:
 * - Avoids recursion stack overhead and potential stack overflow
 * - Often more efficient due to better memory locality
 * - Usually simpler to implement with loops rather than recursion
 * - Easier to optimize for space complexity in many cases
