/**
 * Dynamic Programming with Memoization
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * This class demonstrates the power of memoization in dynamic programming,
 * particularly focusing on top-down recursive approaches.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * 1. Memoization is a technique to avoid redundant calculations by storing previously
 *    computed results in a "memo" data structure (often an array or hash map)
 * 2. It transforms an exponential time recursive algorithm into a linear time algorithm
 * 3. It follows a "top-down" approach: starting from the original problem and breaking it down
 * 4. Memoization maintains the recursive structure while eliminating redundant calculations
 *
 * Contrast with bottom-up DP:
 * - Top-down (memoization): Recursive, starts with the original problem, caches results
 * - Bottom-up (tabulation): Iterative, starts with base cases, builds up to the solution

     * Space complexity: O(n) - for the memoization array and recursion stack
