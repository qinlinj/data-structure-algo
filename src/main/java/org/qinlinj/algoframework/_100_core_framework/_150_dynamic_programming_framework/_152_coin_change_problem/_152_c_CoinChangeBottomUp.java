/**
 * Dynamic Programming: Coin Change Bottom-Up Solution & Summary
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This class implements the bottom-up (iterative) approach for the Coin Change problem
 * and provides a comprehensive summary of dynamic programming concepts.
 *
 * Key Points About Dynamic Programming:
 *
 * 1. Dynamic Programming (DP) is fundamentally about efficient enumeration
 *    - At its core, DP is about solving problems by exploring all possibilities
 *    - The art is in finding "smart ways to enumerate" all possibilities
 *
 * 2. Three essential elements for DP problems:
 *    - Overlapping subproblems: Same subproblems are solved repeatedly
 *    - Optimal substructure: Optimal solution built from optimal solutions of subproblems
 *    - State transition equation: Mathematical relationship between states
 *
 * 3. General approach to solving DP problems:
 *    - Identify states and choices
 *    - Define the meaning of the dp array/function
 *    - Establish base cases
 *    - Write the state transition equation
 *    - Decide between top-down or bottom-up implementation
 *    - Optimize for space if possible
 *
 * This class demonstrates the bottom-up approach to the Coin Change problem,
 * which builds solutions iteratively from the base case up to the target amount.

/**
 * Dynamic Programming Summary
 *
 * 1. Framework for Solving DP Problems:
 *    a. Define the state variables
 *    b. Define the dp array/function meaning
 *    c. Define base cases
 *    d. Define state transitions
 *    e. Choose implementation approach (recursive with memoization or iterative)
 *
 * 2. Similarities and Differences:
 *    - Recursive (top-down) with memoization:
 *      * Starts from the original problem
 *      * Breaks down into subproblems
 *      * Uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations
 *      * Usually more intuitive to write
 *
 *    - Iterative (bottom-up) with tabulation:
 *      * Starts from base cases
 *      * Builds up to the original problem
 *      * Systematically fills a dp table
 *      * Usually more efficient (avoids recursion overhead)
 *
 * 3. Key Insight: The most challenging part is identifying the state transition equation.
 *    - This equation directly represents the recursive structure of the problem
 *    - Once you have this equation, the rest is implementation details
 *
 * 4. Space Optimization:
 *    - Often the final step in optimizing a DP solution
 *    - Based on analyzing which previous states are actually needed

/**
 * Final Thoughts on Dynamic Programming:
 *
 * 1. Computer problem-solving is fundamentally about enumeration (trying all possibilities)
 *
 * 2. Algorithm design involves two steps:
 *    - Figuring out how to enumerate all possibilities
 *    - Finding smart ways to enumerate efficiently
 *
 * 3. DP is powerful because it:
 *    - Eliminates redundant calculations through memoization/tabulation
 *    - Provides a systematic approach to problem decomposition
 *    - Trades space for time, which is often a beneficial tradeoff
 *
 * 4. The key to mastering DP is focusing on:
 *    - Identifying states and choices
 *    - Formulating clear state transition equations
 *    - Practice, practice, practice!
