/**
 * Dynamic Programming: Coin Change Bottom-Up Solution & Summary
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This class implements the bottom-up (iterative) approach for the Coin Change problem
 * and provides a comprehensive summary of dynamic programming concepts.
 *
 * Key Points About Dynamic Programming:
 *
 * 1. Dynamic Programming (DP) is fundamentally about efficient enumeration
 *    - At its core, DP is about solving problems by exploring all possibilities
 *    - The art is in finding "smart ways to enumerate" all possibilities
 *
 * 2. Three essential elements for DP problems:
 *    - Overlapping subproblems: Same subproblems are solved repeatedly
 *    - Optimal substructure: Optimal solution built from optimal solutions of subproblems
 *    - State transition equation: Mathematical relationship between states
 *
 * 3. General approach to solving DP problems:
 *    - Identify states and choices
 *    - Define the meaning of the dp array/function
 *    - Establish base cases
 *    - Write the state transition equation
 *    - Decide between top-down or bottom-up implementation
 *    - Optimize for space if possible
 *
 * This class demonstrates the bottom-up approach to the Coin Change problem,
 * which builds solutions iteratively from the base case up to the target amount.
