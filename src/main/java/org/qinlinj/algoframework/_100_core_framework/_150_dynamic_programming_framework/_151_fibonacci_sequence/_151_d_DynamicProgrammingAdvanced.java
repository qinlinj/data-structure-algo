/**
 * Dynamic Programming: State Transition Equations & Space Optimization
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This class explores two critical aspects of dynamic programming:
 * 1. The importance of state transition equations
 * 2. Space optimization techniques
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - State transition equation: The mathematical representation of how a problem's solution
 *   at one state relates to solutions at other states. It's the core of dynamic programming.
 * - Space optimization: Techniques to reduce memory usage by only storing necessary states.
 *
 * Understanding state transition equations:
 * - They directly represent the recursive (brute force) solution
 * - They describe how the current state depends on previous states
 * - Identifying them is often the most challenging part of solving DP problems
 * - All DP implementations (recursive, memoized, tabulated) are built around them
