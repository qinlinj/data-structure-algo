/**
 * Dynamic Programming: Coin Change Problem
 * ----------------------------------------
 *
 * This class explores the famous "Coin Change" problem (LeetCode 322) as a case study
 * for understanding dynamic programming concepts, particularly:
 *
 * 1. Optimal substructure
 * 2. State identification
 * 3. State transition equations
 * 4. Recursive vs iterative solutions
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given an array of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum
 * number of coins needed to make up that amount. Return -1 if the amount
 * cannot be made up by any combination of coins.
