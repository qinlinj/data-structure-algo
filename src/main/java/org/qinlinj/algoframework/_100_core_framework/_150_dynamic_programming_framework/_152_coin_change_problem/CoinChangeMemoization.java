/**
 * Dynamic Programming: Coin Change with Memoization
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how to apply memoization to the Coin Change problem,
 * significantly improving the performance of the recursive solution.
 * <p>
 * The approach uses the same recursive structure as the brute force solution,
 * but adds a "memo" array to store the results of already solved subproblems,
 * thereby eliminating redundant calculations.
 * <p>
 * Key insights:
 * 1. The memoization technique transforms an exponential algorithm to polynomial time
 * 2. This approach maintains the intuitive recursive formulation
 * 3. The "memo" array serves a similar purpose to the DP table in bottom-up approaches
