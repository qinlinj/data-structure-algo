/**
 * BINARY TREE LEVEL-ORDER TRAVERSAL
 * ================================
 * <p>
 * While most binary tree algorithms employ recursion (DFS), level-order traversal uses iteration
 * with a queue (BFS). This approach is vital for many graph algorithms and has unique advantages:
 * <p>
 * - Processes nodes level by level, from top to bottom
 * - Within each level, processes nodes from left to right
 * - Ideal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs
 * - Provides a breadth-first view of the tree structure
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates three approaches to level-order traversal:
 * 1. Standard iterative BFS (most common and efficient)
 * 2. Recursive DFS that simulates level-order traversal using depth tracking
 * 3. Recursive BFS implementation that processes levels recursively
 * <p>
 * The fundamental BFS framework seen in level-order traversal extends to many graph algorithms,
 * particularly those requiring shortest path calculations.
