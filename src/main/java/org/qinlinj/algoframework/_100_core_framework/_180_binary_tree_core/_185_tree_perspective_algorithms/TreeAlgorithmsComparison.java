/**
 * UNDERSTANDING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING, BACKTRACKING AND DFS FROM A TREE PERSPECTIVE
 * ===============================================================================
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how dynamic programming, backtracking, and DFS algorithms
 * can all be viewed as extensions of binary tree algorithms, with each focusing on
 * different aspects:
 * <p>
 * 1. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
 * - Uses a "problem decomposition" approach (divide and conquer)
 * - Focus is on entire "subtrees"
 * - Builds solutions by combining results from subproblems
 * - Often uses return values to propagate solutions upward
 * <p>
 * 2. BACKTRACKING:
 * - Uses a "traversal" approach
 * - Focus is on the "branches" between nodes
 * - Makes choices along paths and backtracks when needed
 * - "Choose" and "unchoose" operations happen inside for-loops
 * <p>
 * 3. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS):
 * - Uses a "traversal" approach
 * - Focus is on individual "nodes"
 * - Performs operations on each node during traversal
 * - "Choose" and "unchoose" operations happen outside for-loops
 * <p>
 * Understanding these distinctions helps choose the right approach for different problems
 * and clarifies why implementation details vary between these related algorithms.
