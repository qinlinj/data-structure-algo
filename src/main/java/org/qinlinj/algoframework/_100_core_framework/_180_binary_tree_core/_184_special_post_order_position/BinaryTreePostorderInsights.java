/**
 * THE SPECIAL PROPERTIES OF POST-ORDER TRAVERSAL
 * ==============================================
 * <p>
 * COMPARATIVE POWER OF TRAVERSAL POSITIONS:
 * <p>
 * 1. PRE-ORDER Position:
 * - Can only access data passed down from parent nodes via function parameters
 * - Often used for operations that don't require information from subtrees
 * - Common for top-down operations and default code placement
 * <p>
 * 2. IN-ORDER Position:
 * - Can access both parameter data and information returned from the left subtree
 * - Particularly useful in Binary Search Trees (BST) - equivalent to traversing a sorted array
 * - Limited application in general binary trees
 * <p>
 * 3. POST-ORDER Position:
 * - Most powerful - can access parameter data AND information from BOTH left and right subtrees
 * - Essential for problems requiring complete subtree information
 * - Enables bottom-up calculations where parent nodes need data from their children
 * - Often the only position where certain problems can be solved efficiently
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT INSIGHT:
 * When you encounter problems related to subtrees, you'll likely need to:
 * 1. Define an appropriate recursive function with a meaningful return value
 * 2. Place your core logic in the post-order position
 * <p>
 * This pattern appears in many tree problems including calculating tree diameters,
 * determining if a tree is balanced, and finding paths with specific properties.
