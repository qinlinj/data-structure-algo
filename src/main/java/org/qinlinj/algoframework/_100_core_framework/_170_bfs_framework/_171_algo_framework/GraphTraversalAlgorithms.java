/**
 * Tree and Graph Traversal Algorithms Summary
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * <p>
 * 1. Algorithm Foundations:
 * - DFS/Backtracking: Essentially recursive traversal of an enumeration tree
 * - BFS: Fundamentally traversal of a graph
 * - Both derive from binary tree traversal algorithms
 * <p>
 * 2. Relationships between algorithms:
 * - DFS/Backtracking → Multi-way tree recursive traversal → Binary tree recursive traversal
 * - BFS → Graph traversal → Multi-way tree traversal with visited array → Binary tree level-order traversal
 * <p>
 * 3. BFS for Shortest Path:
 * - BFS is often used for finding shortest paths because it explores nodes level by level
 * - Similar to finding the minimum depth in a binary tree
 * - Recursive traversal must visit all nodes, while level-order traversal can find the target earlier
 * <p>
 * 4. Problem Abstraction:
 * - Real-world problems require abstracting specific scenarios into standard graph/tree structures
 * - Examples: maze paths, word transformations, connecting-blocks games
 * <p>
 * 5. BFS Framework:
 * - Multiple implementation approaches with increasing complexity and flexibility
 * - Most common approach uses a queue with step counting
