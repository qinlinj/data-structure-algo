 * Backtracking Algorithm Framework and Explanation
 * -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Overview:
 * Backtracking is essentially a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm applied to a decision tree.
 * It systematically explores all possible solutions by building candidates incrementally and
 * abandoning a candidate (backtracking) when it determines the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
 *
 * Core Concepts:
 * 1. Path: Choices already made in the current exploration.
 * 2. Choice List: Available choices at the current decision point.
 * 3. Termination Condition: Criteria to identify when a complete solution is found.
 *
 * The Algorithm Framework:
 * - At each decision point, try each available choice
 * - Make a choice and mark it as used
 * - Recursively explore with this choice added to the path
 * - Undo the choice (backtrack) and try the next option
 *
 * Visualization of a Decision Tree:
 * - Each node represents a state in the solution construction
 * - Each branch represents a choice
 * - Leaf nodes represent either complete solutions or dead-ends
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Generally high (often exponential or factorial)
 * - Unlike dynamic programming, backtracking doesn't benefit from overlapping subproblems
 * - For permutation problems: O(n!)
 *
 * Common Pattern in Code:
 * ```
 * void backtrack(path, choices) {
 *     if (terminationCondition) {
 *         saveResult(path);
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 *     for (choice in choices) {
 *         // Make choice
 *         add choice to path;
 *         mark choice as used;
 *
 *         // Recursive exploration
 *         backtrack(path, choices);
 *
 *         // Undo choice (backtrack)
 *         remove choice from path;
 *         mark choice as unused;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This class demonstrates backtracking algorithm using the classic permutation problem as an example.
