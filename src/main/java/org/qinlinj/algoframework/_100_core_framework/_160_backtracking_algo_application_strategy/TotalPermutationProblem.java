/**
 * Backtracking Algorithm Framework and Explanation
 * -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Overview:
 * Backtracking is essentially a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm applied to a decision tree.
 * It systematically explores all possible solutions by building candidates incrementally and
 * abandoning a candidate (backtracking) when it determines the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
 *
 * Core Concepts:
 * 1. Path: Choices already made in the current exploration.
 * 2. Choice List: Available choices at the current decision point.
 * 3. Termination Condition: Criteria to identify when a complete solution is found.
