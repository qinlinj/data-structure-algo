/**
 * Backtracking Algorithm Framework and Explanation
 * -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Overview:
 * Backtracking is essentially a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm applied to a decision tree.
 * It systematically explores all possible solutions by building candidates incrementally and
 * abandoning a candidate (backtracking) when it determines the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
 *
 * Core Concepts:
 * 1. Path: Choices already made in the current exploration.
 * 2. Choice List: Available choices at the current decision point.
 * 3. Termination Condition: Criteria to identify when a complete solution is found.
 *
 * The Algorithm Framework:
 * - At each decision point, try each available choice
 * - Make a choice and mark it as used
 * - Recursively explore with this choice added to the path
 * - Undo the choice (backtrack) and try the next option
 *
 * Visualization of a Decision Tree:
 * - Each node represents a state in the solution construction
 * - Each branch represents a choice
 * - Leaf nodes represent either complete solutions or dead-ends
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Generally high (often exponential or factorial)
 * - Unlike dynamic programming, backtracking doesn't benefit from overlapping subproblems
 * - For permutation problems: O(n!)
