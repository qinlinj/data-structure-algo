/**
 * SUMMARY OF COMBINATION GENERATION USING BACKTRACKING
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how to generate all k-sized combinations from numbers 1 to n
 * using the backtracking algorithm technique.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Combination Problem (LeetCode 77): Given two integers n and k, return all possible
 * combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].
 * <p>
 * 2. Relationship to Subset Problem:
 * - A k-sized combination is essentially a k-sized subset
 * - While subset generation collects nodes at all levels of the recursion tree,
 * combination generation only collects nodes at a specific level (k)
 * - The core algorithm structure remains the same
 * <p>
 * 3. Backtracking Approach:
 * - Uses a recursive tree traversal strategy
 * - Each complete path to level k represents a valid combination
 * - The "start" parameter prevents duplicate combinations by maintaining ordering
 * - Only solutions with exactly k elements are collected
 * <p>
 * 4. Implementation Strategy:
 * - Use a "track" list to record the current path during recursion
 * - Use a "start" parameter to control which elements can be chosen next
 * - Add to result only when we reach exactly k elements (modified base case)
 * - Follow the standard backtracking pattern: choose → explore → unchoose
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(k * C(n,k)) where C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient
 * Space Complexity: O(k) for recursion stack and tracking current combination
