/**
 * Monotonic Stack - Summary and Overview
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive overview of the monotonic stack pattern and its applications.
 * <p>
 * What is a Monotonic Stack?
 * - A stack that maintains elements in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order
 * - Elements are pushed and popped according to specific rules to maintain this order
 * - Particularly useful for problems involving finding next/previous greater/smaller elements
 * <p>
 * Key Characteristics:
 * 1. Linear time complexity O(n) despite nested loops (each element pushed/popped at most once)
 * 2. Space complexity O(n) in worst case
 * 3. Can be adapted to handle circular arrays using modulo operations
 * <p>
 * Common Problem Patterns:
 * - Next Greater Element: First greater element to the right
 * - Previous Greater Element: First greater element to the left
 * - Next Smaller Element: First smaller element to the right
 * - Previous Smaller Element: First smaller element to the left
 * <p>
 * Real-world Applications:
 * - Stock price analysis
 * - Temperature forecasting
 * - Building/skyline problems
 * - Histogram calculations
 * - Parsing and syntax analysis
