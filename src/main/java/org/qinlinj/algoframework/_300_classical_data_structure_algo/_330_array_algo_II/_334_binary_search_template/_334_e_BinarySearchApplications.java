 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates practical applications of binary search algorithms.
 * <p>
 * BINARY SEARCH APPLICATIONS:
 * -------------------------
 * 1. Solving LeetCode Problem #34: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
 * - This uses both left and right bound binary search
 * <p>
 * 2. Finding the smallest element >= target (ceiling) and largest element <= target (floor)
 * - Useful for approximation and range queries
 * <p>
 * 3. Searching in rotated sorted arrays
 * - Modified binary search that handles rotation point
 * <p>
 * 4. Finding peek element in a mountain array
 * - Using binary search on arrays that are not strictly monotonic
 * <p>
 * KEY TAKEAWAYS:
 * -------------
 * 1. Binary search is not just for exact matches - it can be used to find boundaries,
 * ranges, and positions in various array structures.
 * <p>
 * 2. The core idea of binary search is to eliminate half of the remaining search space
 * in each iteration.
 * <p>
 * 3. Always be careful with these details:
 * - Search interval definition: [left, right] or [left, right)
 * - Loop termination condition: left <= right or left < right
 * - Mid calculation: mid = left + (right - left) / 2 (avoids overflow)
 * - Boundary updates: mid+1, mid-1, or just mid
 * - Edge case handling: empty arrays, targets not present, etc.
