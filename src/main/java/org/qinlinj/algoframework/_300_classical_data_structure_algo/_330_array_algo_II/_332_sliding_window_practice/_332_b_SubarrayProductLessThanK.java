/**
 * LeetCode 713: Subarray Product Less Than K
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of
 * contiguous subarrays where the product of all elements in the subarray is strictly
 * less than k.
 * <p>
 * Key Insight:
 * The sliding window technique works well here because:
 * 1. All elements are positive, so adding elements always increases the product
 * 2. Removing elements always decreases the product
 * 3. This monotonic property allows us to efficiently find all valid subarrays
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space
 * <p>
 * Sliding Window Approach:
 * 1. Maintain a sliding window where the product of all elements is less than k
 * 2. For each right pointer position, count all valid subarrays ending at that position
 * 3. Shrink the window from the left when the product exceeds or equals k
