/**
 * Example 2: Shipping Packages within Days (LeetCode 1011)
 * <p>
 * Problem:
 * - Packages with weights must be shipped in order within D days
 * - Each day, we load packages in order onto the conveyor belt
 * - We can only load packages with a total weight â‰¤ the ship's capacity
 * - Find the minimum capacity of the ship needed to ship all packages within D days
 * <p>
 * Binary search solution:
 * - Variable x: Ship's capacity (weight units)
 * - Function f(x): The days needed to ship all packages with capacity x
 * - Target: The given D days
 * - Goal: Find the minimum capacity x where f(x) <= D
