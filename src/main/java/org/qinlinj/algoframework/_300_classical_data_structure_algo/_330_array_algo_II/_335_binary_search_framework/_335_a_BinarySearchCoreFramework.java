/**
 * Binary Search Core Framework - Summary
 * <p>
 * This file summarizes key concepts about generalizing binary search beyond sorted arrays.
 * <p>
 * Binary search can be used to solve various problems efficiently when:
 * 1. You can identify a monotonic function f(x) of a variable x
 * 2. You want to find a value of x where f(x) meets a specific target constraint
 * <p>
 * Binary Search Framework:
 * 1. Identify the variable x, function f(x), and target value
 * 2. Determine the search range for x (min and max possible values)
 * 3. Decide whether to search for left boundary or right boundary
 * 4. Implement binary search algorithm accordingly
 * <p>
 * The article discusses several examples demonstrating this framework:
 * - Finding elements in sorted arrays (basic binary search)
 * - Koko eating bananas (finding minimum eating speed)
 * - Shipping packages within days (finding minimum capacity)
 * - Splitting array into subarrays (minimizing maximum subarray sum)
 * <p>
 * This class organizes these concepts into separate examples.
