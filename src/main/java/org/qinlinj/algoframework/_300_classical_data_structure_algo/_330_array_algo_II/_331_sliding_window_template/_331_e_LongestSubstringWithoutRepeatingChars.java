/**
 * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode 3)
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Use sliding window approach with dynamic window size
 * 2. Use HashMap/Counter to track character occurrences in the window
 * 3. When a duplicate is found, shrink the window from left until the duplicate is removed
 * 4. Update the maximum length after window adjustments
 * 5. Time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of string s
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3 (The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc")
