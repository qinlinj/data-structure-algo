/**
 * Binary Search Applications - Finding Peak Elements
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Using binary search to find a peak element in an unsorted array
 * 2. Leveraging the local trend (increasing or decreasing) to narrow the search
 * 3. Simplified approach focusing only on mid and mid+1 elements
 * <p>
 * This class implements LeetCode 162: Find Peak Element
 * Problem: Find any peak element in an array where a peak is strictly greater than its neighbors
 * <p>
 * The key insight is that we don't need to compare mid with both left and right neighbors.
 * Instead, we can simply compare mid with mid+1 to determine the trend and narrow our search.

    /**
     * Why this works:
     * <p>
     * 1. If nums[mid] > nums[mid+1], we're on a downward slope, which means:
     * - Either mid is a peak (if nums[mid-1] < nums[mid])
     * - Or there's a peak to the left of mid
     * <p>
     * 2. If nums[mid] < nums[mid+1], we're on an upward slope, which means:
     * - There must be a peak to the right of mid
     * <p>
     * Since the array is guaranteed to have a peak (boundaries are -âˆž),
     * this approach will always find a peak.
