/**
 * Permutation in String (LeetCode 567)
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1,
 * or false otherwise. In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations
 * is the substring of s2.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. This is a fixed-length sliding window problem
 * 2. Window size must equal the length of s1
 * 3. Use counter/HashMap to track character frequencies
 * 4. Time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of s2
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
 * Output: true (s2 contains "ba", which is a permutation of s1)
