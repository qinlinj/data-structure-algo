/**
 * Matrix Rotation Techniques
 * =========================
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates techniques for rotating a matrix in-place.
 * While many matrix operations seem complex with the usual approach,
 * they can often be simplified by combining basic transformations.
 * <p>
 * Key Techniques:
 * 1. Clockwise 90° Rotation:
 * - Transpose the matrix along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
 * - Reverse each row
 * <p>
 * 2. Counter-clockwise 90° Rotation:
 * - Transpose the matrix along the anti-diagonal (bottom-left to top-right)
 * - Reverse each row
 * <p>
 * These techniques demonstrate how complex matrix operations can be broken down
 * into simpler transformations, illustrating that sometimes the most elegant
 * solution is not the most intuitive one.
 * <p>
 * Similar principles apply to other problems like:
 * - Reversing words in a string in-place
 * - Rotating a linked list
