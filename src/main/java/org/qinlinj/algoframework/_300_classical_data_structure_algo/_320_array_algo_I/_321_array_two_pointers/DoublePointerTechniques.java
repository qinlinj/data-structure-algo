/**
 * Double Pointer Techniques in Arrays and Linked Lists
 * ===================================================
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates various double pointer techniques commonly used in array and linked list algorithms.
 * Double pointer techniques can be classified into two main categories:
 * <p>
 * 1. Fast-Slow Pointers: Two pointers moving in the same direction at different speeds
 * 2. Left-Right Pointers: Two pointers moving toward or away from each other
 * <p>
 * FAST-SLOW POINTER TECHNIQUES:
 * -----------------------------
 * 1. In-place Array Modification:
 * - Used when we need to modify arrays without using extra space
 * - Common operations include removing duplicates, removing specific elements
 * - Slow pointer maintains the boundary of the processed section
 * - Fast pointer scans through the entire array
 * <p>
 * 2. Sliding Window:
 * - Used for finding subarrays that satisfy certain conditions
 * - Two pointers define the boundaries of the window
 * - Window expands/contracts based on specific conditions
 * <p>
 * LEFT-RIGHT POINTER TECHNIQUES:
 * -----------------------------
 * 1. Binary Search:
 * - Efficient search in sorted arrays
 * - Left and right pointers define the search space
 * <p>
 * 2. Two Sum (and n-Sum):
 * - Finding elements that sum to a target in a sorted array
 * - Two pointers move toward each other
 * <p>
 * 3. Array Reversal:
 * - Swapping elements from opposite ends
 * <p>
 * 4. Palindrome Detection:
 * - Check if a string reads the same backward as forward
 * - Two pointers moving from outside to inside or inside to outside
