/**
 * Generalized N-Sum Solution
 * =========================
 * <p>
 * This class implements a recursive solution to the generalized n-Sum problem.
 * Given an array of integers and a target value, it can find all unique combinations
 * of n elements that sum to the target value.
 * <p>
 * The implementation follows a recursive approach:
 * - When n = 2, it uses the two-pointer technique (base case)
 * - When n > 2, it reduces the problem to (n-1)-Sum by fixing one element
 * <p>
 * This solution works for any value of n, from 2-Sum all the way to 100-Sum,
 * though the time complexity grows exponentially with n.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(N^(n-1)) where N is the length of the array and n is the number of elements
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack (excluding output space)
