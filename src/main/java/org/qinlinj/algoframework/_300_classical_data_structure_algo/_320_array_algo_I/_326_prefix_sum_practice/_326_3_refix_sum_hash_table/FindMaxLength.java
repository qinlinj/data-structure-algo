/**
 * Contiguous Array (LeetCode 525)
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * 1. Combines prefix sum technique with hash map for optimal solution
 * 2. Treats 0's as -1 and 1's as 1 to transform the problem
 * 3. Finding subarrays with equal 0's and 1's becomes finding subarrays with sum 0
 * 4. Uses a hash map to track prefix sum values and their first occurrence indices
 * 5. Time complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
 * 6. Space complexity: O(n) for the hash map and prefix sum array
 * 7. Demonstrates how problem transformation can simplify solution
