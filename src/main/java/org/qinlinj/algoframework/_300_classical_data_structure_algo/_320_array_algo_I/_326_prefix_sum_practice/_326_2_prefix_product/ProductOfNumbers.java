/**
 * Product of the Last K Numbers (LeetCode 1352)
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * 1. Uses prefix product technique to efficiently calculate product of last k numbers
 * 2. Maintains a running prefix product list to avoid recalculation
 * 3. Special handling for zeros in the input stream
 * 4. Time complexity: O(1) for both add and getProduct operations
 * 5. Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements added
 * 6. Demonstrates how prefix products can be used for efficient range product queries
 * 7. Similar to prefix sum but uses multiplication operation instead of addition
