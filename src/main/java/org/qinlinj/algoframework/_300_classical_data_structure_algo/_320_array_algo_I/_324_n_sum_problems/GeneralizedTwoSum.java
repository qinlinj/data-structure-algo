/**
 * Generalized Two Sum Solutions
 * ============================
 * <p>
 * This class implements multiple variations of the Two Sum problem.
 * <p>
 * Problem Variations:
 * 1. Basic Two Sum: Find one pair of elements that sum to a target
 * 2. All Pairs Two Sum: Find all unique pairs of elements that sum to a target
 * <p>
 * Both problems are solved using the two-pointer technique for efficiency,
 * which requires the array to be sorted first.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting operation
 * Space Complexity: O(1) for the algorithm itself (excluding output space)
