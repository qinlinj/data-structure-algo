/**
 * Corporate Flight Bookings (LeetCode 1109)
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * 1. This problem is a disguised application of the difference array technique
 * 2. Each booking represents a range update operation
 * 3. The problem requires 1-indexed arrays, so we need to adjust indices
 * 4. Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n is number of flights and m is number of bookings
 * 5. Space Complexity: O(n) for the difference array
