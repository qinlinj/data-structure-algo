/**
 * Spiral Matrix Techniques
 * =======================
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates techniques for traversing and generating matrices in a spiral pattern.
 * These techniques are commonly used in coding interviews and competitive programming.
 * <p>
 * The core principle is to define four boundaries (upper, lower, left, right) and traverse
 * the matrix in a clockwise direction: right → down → left → up, adjusting the boundaries
 * as we complete each direction.
 * <p>
 * Two main operations are implemented:
 * 1. Spiral Traversal: Return all elements of a matrix in spiral order
 * 2. Spiral Generation: Create a matrix with numbers 1 to n² in spiral order
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix
 * Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the output array
