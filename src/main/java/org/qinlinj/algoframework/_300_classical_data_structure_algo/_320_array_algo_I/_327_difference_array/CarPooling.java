/**
 * Car Pooling (LeetCode 1094)
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * 1. Another application of the difference array technique
 * 2. Each trip represents passengers getting on at one stop and off at another
 * 3. Uses difference array to track passenger count changes at each location
 * 4. After processing all trips, checks if capacity is ever exceeded
 * 5. Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n is the number of stops and m is the number of trips
 * 6. Space Complexity: O(n) for the difference array
