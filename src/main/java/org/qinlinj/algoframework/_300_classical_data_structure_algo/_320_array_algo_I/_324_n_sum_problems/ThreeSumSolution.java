/**
 * Three Sum Solution (LeetCode 15)
 * ==============================
 * <p>
 * This class implements solutions to the Three Sum problem and its generalized variant.
 * <p>
 * Problem:
 * Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array that give a sum of zero
 * (or a specified target value in the generalized version).
 * <p>
 * Approach:
 * 1. Sort the array (to handle duplicates efficiently)
 * 2. Iterate through each element as a potential first element of the triplet
 * 3. For each element, use the two-pointer technique to find pairs that complete the triplet
 * 4. Skip duplicate values to avoid duplicate triplets
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the array
 * Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the output space
