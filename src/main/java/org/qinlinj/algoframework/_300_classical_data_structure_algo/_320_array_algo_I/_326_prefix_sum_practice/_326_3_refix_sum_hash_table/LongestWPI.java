/**
 * Longest Well-Performing Interval (LeetCode 1124)
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * 1. Combines prefix sum technique with hash map for optimal solution
 * 2. Transforms the problem by converting hours > 8 to +1 and hours â‰¤ 8 to -1
 * 3. A "well-performing interval" becomes a subarray with positive sum
 * 4. Uses a hash map to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum
 * 5. Time complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
 * 6. Space complexity: O(n) for the hash map and prefix sum array
 * 7. Special case handling for positive prefix sums
