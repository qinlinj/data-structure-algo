/**
 * LINKED LIST MERGING APPLICATIONS
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how the concept of merging linked lists can be applied
 * to solve problems that don't explicitly involve linked lists.
 * <p>
 * KEY CONCEPT:
 * Merging sorted lists is a fundamental technique that extends beyond actual linked lists.
 * It can be applied to:
 * 1. Generate sequences with certain properties (like ugly numbers)
 * 2. Find specific elements in sorted matrices
 * 3. Find optimal pairs from multiple sorted arrays
 * <p>
 * CORE TECHNIQUES:
 * <p>
 * 1. Multi-Source Merging
 * - Treating different sources of sorted elements as "virtual linked lists"
 * - Using pointers/indices to track progress through each source
 * - Selecting the minimum element across all sources at each step
 * <p>
 * 2. Priority Queue Optimization
 * - Using a min-heap to efficiently select the next smallest element
 * - Adding "successor" elements to maintain the flow of elements
 * - Particularly useful when merging more than two sources
 * <p>
 * 3. Applying Linked List Merging Patterns
 * - Recognizing when a problem can be modeled as merging sorted sequences
 * - Adapting linked list merging algorithms to different data structures
 * - Using similar pointer/index manipulation techniques
