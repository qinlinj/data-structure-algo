/**
 * LINKED LIST DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates techniques for decomposing a linked list,
 * specifically focusing on removing duplicate elements from sorted linked lists.
 * <p>
 * KEY TECHNIQUES:
 * <p>
 * 1. List Decomposition
 * - Splitting a linked list into multiple lists based on certain criteria
 * - Using dummy nodes to track the head of each new list
 * - Recombining lists as needed
 * - Can be applied whenever we need to filter/select nodes from a linked list
 * <p>
 * 2. Fast/Slow Pointers
 * - Using two pointers that move at different paces
 * - Helps in identifying patterns like duplicates, cycles, etc.
 * - Often more space-efficient than using additional data structures
 * <p>
 * 3. Recursive Approach
 * - Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems
 * - Handling the base case and building the solution recursively
 * - Particularly useful for operations that can be defined in terms of themselves
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM FOCUS:
 * LeetCode 82: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
 * Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers,
 * leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
 * Return the linked list sorted as well.
