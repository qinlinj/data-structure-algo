/**
 * REVERSING LINKED LIST IN K-GROUPS
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates techniques for reversing linked lists in groups of K nodes,
 * which is a more complex variation of linked list reversal problems.
 * <p>
 * KEY TECHNIQUES:
 * <p>
 * 1. K-Group Reversal
 * - Breaking the list into segments of K nodes
 * - Reversing each segment independently
 * - Maintaining proper connections between segments
 * - Handling the last segment if it contains fewer than K nodes
 * <p>
 * 2. Recursive Approach
 * - Using recursive structure to process each K-group
 * - Leveraging the "reverseN" function to reverse each segment
 * - Reconnecting segments through recursive calls
 * <p>
 * 3. Iterative Approach
 * - Using dummy nodes and multiple pointers to track segments
 * - Manually reversing each K-group and reconnecting
 * - Constant space complexity without using the call stack
