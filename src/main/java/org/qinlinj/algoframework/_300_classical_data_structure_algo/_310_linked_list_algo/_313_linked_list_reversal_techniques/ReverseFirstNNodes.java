/**
 * REVERSING FIRST N NODES OF A LINKED LIST
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates techniques for reversing just the first N nodes of a linked list,
 * which is a variation of the complete list reversal problem.
 * <p>
 * KEY TECHNIQUES:
 * <p>
 * 1. Iterative Approach
 * - Similar to complete reversal but stops after N nodes
 * - Properly connects the reversed portion with the remainder of the list
 * - Handles edge cases for N values
 * <p>
 * 2. Recursive Approach
 * - Uses a successor pointer to track the N+1 node
 * - Base case changes to stopping at the Nth node
 * - Carefully reconnects the reversed portion with the remainder
 * <p>
 * 3. Special Considerations
 * - Handling cases where N equals the list length
 * - Proper connection between the reversed portion and the rest of the list
 * - Maintaining the integrity of the original list structure
