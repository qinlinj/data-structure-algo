/**
 * LINKED LIST ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how to perform arithmetic operations using linked lists,
 * particularly focusing on addition operations.
 * <p>
 * KEY TECHNIQUES:
 * <p>
 * 1. Reverse Order Addition (LeetCode 2)
 * - Handles numbers stored in reverse order (least significant digit first)
 * - Simulates the standard digit-by-digit addition with carry
 * - Uses a dummy node to simplify edge cases
 * <p>
 * 2. Forward Order Addition (LeetCode 445)
 * - Handles numbers stored in forward order (most significant digit first)
 * - Uses stacks to reverse the order or performs in-place reversal
 * - Demonstrates different approaches to handle digit misalignment
 * <p>
 * COMMON PATTERNS:
 * <p>
 * 1. Carry Handling
 * - Tracking and propagating carry values between digits
 * - Managing carryover at the most significant digit
 * <p>
 * 2. Dummy Node Technique
 * - Using a placeholder node to simplify the head insertion logic
 * - Helps handle the case when a new digit needs to be added at the beginning
 * <p>
 * 3. Two-Pointer Traversal
 * - Walking through multiple lists simultaneously
 * - Handling lists of different lengths
