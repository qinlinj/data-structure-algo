     * Finds the minimum window substring that contains all characters from string t.
     *
     * This solution implements the sliding window algorithm to efficiently find the
     * smallest substring in s that contains all characters from t, including duplicates.
     *
     * Visual example:
     * For s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
     *
     * Initial state:
     * "ADOBECODEBANC"
     *  l
     *  r
     * window: {} valid: 0/3
     *
     * After expanding window to include all necessary characters:
     * "ADOBECODEBANC"
     *  l            r
     * window: {A:1, B:1, C:1} valid: 3/3
     *
     * After first minimum found and shrinking:
     * "ADOBECODEBANC"
     *            l  r
     * window: {A:1, B:1, C:1} valid: 3/3
     * Minimum window: "BANC"
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of string s
     * Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the character set (in this case, at most 52)
     *
     * @param s The source string
     * @param t The target string containing characters to be found
     * @return The minimum window substring containing all characters from t
