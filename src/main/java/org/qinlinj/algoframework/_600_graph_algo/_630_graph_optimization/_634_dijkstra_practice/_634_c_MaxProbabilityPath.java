 * Path with Maximum Probability - Modified Dijkstra Algorithm
 * LeetCode 1514: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/
 * <p>
 * Knowledge Points:
 * 1. Application of Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path with maximum probability
 * <p>
 * 2. Problem Translation:
 * - Nodes in the graph are the vertices
 * - Edges have weights representing success probabilities (between 0 and 1)
 * - Find the path from start to end with the highest overall probability
 * - Overall probability is the product of probabilities along the path
 * <p>
 * 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm Modification:
 * - Standard Dijkstra finds the minimum path sum
 * - For maximum probability, we need the maximum path product
 * - Invert the priority queue comparison to prioritize higher probabilities
 * - Each edge decreases the total probability (since probabilities are â‰¤ 1)
 * <p>
 * 4. Key Insight:
 * - Dijkstra's algorithm works for "optimal" paths, not just shortest paths
 * - It works when each added edge either consistently increases or decreases the path weight
 * - When edges consistently decrease the path value (as with probability products),
 * we can use Dijkstra to find the maximum value path
 * <p>
 * 5. Time Complexity: O(E log E) where E is the number of edges
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices
