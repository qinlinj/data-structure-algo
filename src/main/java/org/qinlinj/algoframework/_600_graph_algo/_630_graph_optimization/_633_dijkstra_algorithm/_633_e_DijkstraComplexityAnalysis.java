/**
 * Complexity Analysis of Dijkstra's Algorithm
 * <p>
 * Knowledge Points:
 * 1. Time Complexity Analysis:
 * - O(E log E) where E is the number of edges
 * - Each edge can potentially add a node to the priority queue
 * - Each priority queue operation takes O(log E) time
 * <p>
 * 2. Space Complexity Analysis:
 * - O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices
 * - O(V) for the distance array
 * - O(E) for the priority queue in worst case
 * <p>
 * 3. Queue Size Analysis:
 * - The priority queue can contain duplicate nodes with different distances
 * - Maximum queue size is related to the sum of in-degrees of all nodes
 * - In a connected graph, the sum of in-degrees equals the number of edges
 * <p>
 * 4. Alternative Analysis:
 * - Some textbooks state O(E log V) time complexity
 * - This is achievable with advanced priority queue implementations
 * - The difference depends on implementation details
