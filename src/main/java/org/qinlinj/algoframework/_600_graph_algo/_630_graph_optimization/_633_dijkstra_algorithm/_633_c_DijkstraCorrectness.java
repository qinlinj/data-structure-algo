 * Correctness Proof and Analysis of Dijkstra's Algorithm
 * <p>
 * Knowledge Points:
 * 1. Correctness Principle:
 * - Dijkstra's algorithm is based on the principle of "expanding certainty"
 * - When a node is first dequeued, its distance is guaranteed to be minimal
 * <p>
 * 2. Proof Strategy:
 * - Start with what we know with certainty (distance to source = 0)
 * - Expand our certainty by always choosing the node with smallest known distance
 * - Prove that this greedy approach guarantees optimal solutions
 * <p>
 * 3. Why Negative Edges Break the Algorithm:
 * - With negative edges, the assumption that adding more edges increases path length fails
 * - A longer path might become shorter by incorporating negative-weight edges
 * <p>
 * 4. Application of the Greedy Principle:
 * - At each step, we make the locally optimal choice (node with smallest distance)
 * - This local optimality leads to global optimality (shortest paths to all nodes)
