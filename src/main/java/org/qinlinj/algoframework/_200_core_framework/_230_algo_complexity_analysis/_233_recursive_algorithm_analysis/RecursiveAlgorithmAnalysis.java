/**
 * Recursive Algorithm Analysis
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates how to analyze the time and space complexity
 * of recursive algorithms by viewing them as tree traversals.
 * <p>
 * Key Principles:
 * <p>
 * 1. Complexity Analysis Framework:
 * - Time Complexity = Number of Recursive Calls × Time Complexity of Each Function Call
 * - Space Complexity = Recursion Stack Depth + Additional Storage Space
 * <p>
 * Or more intuitively:
 * - Time Complexity = Number of Nodes in Recursion Tree × Time Complexity at Each Node
 * - Space Complexity = Height of Recursion Tree + Additional Storage Space
 * <p>
 * 2. Dynamic Programming Analysis:
 * - For brute force recursion: exponential time complexity (e.g., O(K^N))
 * - With memoization: complexity reduces to O(States × Time per State)
 * - Bottom-up iteration: same time complexity as memoization but better space efficiency
 * <p>
 * 3. Backtracking Algorithm Analysis:
 * - Permutation problems: approximately O(N^2 × N!) time complexity
 * - Subset (power set) problems: approximately O(N × 2^N) time complexity
 * - Analysis focuses on counting recursion tree nodes and work at each node
