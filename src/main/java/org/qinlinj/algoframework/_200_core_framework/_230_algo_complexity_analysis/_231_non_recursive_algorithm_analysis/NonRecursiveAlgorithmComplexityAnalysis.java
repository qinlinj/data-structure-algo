/**
 * Algorithm Complexity Analysis Guide
 * <p>
 * This class summarizes key concepts for analyzing time and space complexity
 * of algorithms, including practical tips and common pitfalls.
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * <p>
 * 1. Using complexity analysis to infer solution approaches:
 * - Pay attention to input data size constraints in problems
 * - Determine allowed time complexity based on input size
 * - Use complexity constraints to narrow down potential algorithms
 * <p>
 * 2. Common coding mistakes leading to inefficient algorithms:
 * - Using unnecessary standard output during algorithm execution
 * - Passing by value instead of reference (especially in recursive calls)
 * - Misunderstanding underlying implementations of interface objects
 * <p>
 * 3. Big O Notation basics:
 * - Only keep the fastest-growing term (dropping constants and slower terms)
 * - Big O represents an upper bound on growth rate
 * - Sometimes a loose upper bound is acceptable when exact analysis is difficult
 * <p>
 * 4. Non-recursive algorithm analysis:
 * - For nested loops, typically multiply each loop's complexity
 * - Special patterns (like sliding window, non-retreating pointers) can be linear
 * - Key insight: Focus on what the algorithm actually does, not just its structure

     * Example: Based on input size, we can infer appropriate algorithms
     * <p>
     * When array length ≈ 10^6:
     * - O(n²) is too slow (10^12 operations)
     * - Need O(n log n) or O(n) solution
     * - Consider: sorting, prefix sum, two pointers, 1D DP
     * <p>
     * When array length ≤ 20:
     * - Exponential solutions may be required
     * - Consider: backtracking, brute force enumeration
