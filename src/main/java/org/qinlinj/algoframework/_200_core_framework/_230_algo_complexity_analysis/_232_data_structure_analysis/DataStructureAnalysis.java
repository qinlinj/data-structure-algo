/**
 * Data Structure Analysis and Amortized Time Complexity
 * <p>
 * This class explains the concept of amortized time complexity analysis for data structures,
 * which differs from analyzing standard algorithms because data structures change dynamically.
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * <p>
 * 1. Dynamic Data Structures:
 * - Data structures like dynamic arrays and hash tables can resize
 * - Operations that trigger resizing have higher time complexity (O(n))
 * - Yet we still describe these operations as O(1) in common usage
 * <p>
 * 2. Amortized Analysis:
 * - We use amortized (average) time complexity instead of worst-case
 * - Amortized analysis distributes the cost of expensive operations across all operations
 * - Three common methods for amortized analysis:
 * a) Aggregate analysis (total cost divided by number of operations)
 * b) Accounting method (saving "credits" for future expensive operations)
 * c) Potential method (using a potential function to track state changes)
 * <p>
 * 3. Examples of Amortized Analysis:
 * - Dynamic array resizing
 * - Hash table rehashing
 * - Monotonic queue operations
