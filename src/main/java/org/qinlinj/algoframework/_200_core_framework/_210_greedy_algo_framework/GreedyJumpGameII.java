/**
 * Jump Game II - Greedy Algorithm Solution
 * ========================================
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates solving the "Jump Game II" problem (LeetCode 45) using
 * both dynamic programming and greedy algorithm approaches, highlighting the
 * efficiency gains from identifying the greedy choice property.
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Given an array where each element represents the maximum jump distance from that position,
 * find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * <p>
 * 1. Dynamic Programming Approach:
 * - Define dp[i] as the minimum jumps needed to reach the end from position i
 * - For each position, try all possible jumps and choose the minimum
 * - Time complexity: O(n²) - Often too slow for large inputs
 * <p>
 * 2. Greedy Algorithm Optimization:
 * - Identify that we don't need to try all jumps at each position
 * - Instead, track the current jump's end boundary and the farthest position reachable
 * - When we reach the current jump's boundary, make a new jump to the farthest position
 * - Time complexity: O(n) - Dramatic improvement
 * <p>
 * 3. Greedy Choice Property Analysis:
 * - At each step, we don't need to recursively compute results for all possible next positions
 * - We can directly choose the position that allows us to reach the farthest
 * - This local optimal choice leads to the global optimal solution
 * <p>
 * General Approach to Greedy Problems:
 * 1. Always start with the brute force (exhaustive enumeration) approach
 * 2. Optimize using dynamic programming if overlapping subproblems exist
 * 3. If still too slow, look for greedy choice properties to avoid full enumeration
 * 4. Verify if local optimal choices lead to the global optimal solution
