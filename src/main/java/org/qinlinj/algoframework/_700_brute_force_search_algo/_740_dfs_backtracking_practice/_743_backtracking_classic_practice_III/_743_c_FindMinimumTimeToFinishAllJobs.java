/**
 * 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs
 * <p>
 * Problem Summary:
 * You need to assign n jobs to k workers, where jobs[i] represents the time needed to complete job i.
 * Each job must be assigned to exactly one worker, and each worker can receive any number of jobs.
 * Find the minimum possible maximum working time of any worker.
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * - This is a job assignment optimization problem that can be solved with backtracking
 * - We can approach this from the jobs' perspective (jobs selecting workers)
 * - Two critical optimizations:
 * 1. If assigning a job would make a worker's time exceed our current best solution, skip it
 * 2. If multiple workers have the same workload, we only need to try one of them
 * (since from the job's perspective, workers with equal workload are identical)
 * - The small input size (â‰¤12 jobs) makes backtracking with optimizations feasible
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(k^n) worst case without optimizations, where n is the number of jobs
 * Space Complexity: O(k) for tracking worker workloads plus recursion stack

    /**
     * Alternative approach: Binary search with feasibility check
     * While not implemented here, we could also solve this with binary search:
     * 1. Binary search for the minimum possible maximum working time
     * 2. For each potential maximum time, check if it's possible to assign jobs
     *    without any worker exceeding that time limit
     * This would change time complexity to O(log(sum(jobs)) * k^n) in worst case,
     * potentially better with proper pruning.
