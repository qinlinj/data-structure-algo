/**
 * 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies
 * <p>
 * Problem Summary:
 * You need to distribute cookie bags among k children. Each bag (cookies[i]) contains a certain
 * number of cookies and must be given to exactly one child. The "unfairness" is defined as the
 * maximum number of cookies any single child receives. Return the minimum possible unfairness.
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * - This problem is nearly identical to "1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs"
 * - We need to distribute resources (cookie bags) to minimize the maximum allocation
 * - The backtracking approach involves trying all possible assignments of bags to children
 * - Same optimizations apply:
 * 1. Skip assignments that would exceed our current best solution
 * 2. Skip trying multiple children with the same current cookie count
 * - The problem size is even smaller (â‰¤8 bags), making backtracking very efficient
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(k^n) worst case without optimizations, where n is the number of cookie bags
 * Space Complexity: O(k) for tracking allocations plus recursion stack
