/**
 * GAS STATION PROBLEM - BRUTE FORCE APPROACH
 * LeetCode 134: Gas Station
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * There are n gas stations along a circular route. At station i, you can get gas[i] liters of gas.
 * To travel from station i to station i+1, you need cost[i] liters of gas.
 * You have a car with unlimited gas tank capacity, starting with empty tank.
 * Find the starting station index to complete the circuit, or return -1 if impossible.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Circular Route: After station n-1, next station is 0
 * 2. Net Gain/Loss: At each station, net change = gas[i] - cost[i]
 * 3. Feasibility: Total gas must be >= total cost for solution to exist
 * 4. Brute Force: Try each station as starting point, simulate the journey
 * <p>
 * Brute Force Analysis:
 * - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - try each of n starting points, simulate n steps each
 * - Space Complexity: O(1) - only use constant extra space
 * - Limitation: Inefficient for large inputs due to redundant calculations
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Steps:
 * 1. For each possible starting station (0 to n-1):
 * a. Initialize tank = 0
 * b. Simulate journey for n steps
 * c. At each step: add gas, subtract cost, check if tank >= 0
 * d. If complete circuit successfully, return starting station
 * 2. If no starting station works, return -1
 * <p>
 * This approach works but contains redundant computations that can be optimized
 * using mathematical insights or greedy strategies.
