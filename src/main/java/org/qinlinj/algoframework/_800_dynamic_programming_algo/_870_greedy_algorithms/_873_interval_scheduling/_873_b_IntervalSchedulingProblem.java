/**
 * INTERVAL SCHEDULING PROBLEM - CLASSIC GREEDY ALGORITHM
 * LeetCode 435: Non-overlapping Intervals (variant)
 * <p>
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given multiple intervals [start, end], find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.
 * Two intervals are non-overlapping if they don't share any common points (touching boundaries allowed).
 * <p>
 * Real-world Applications:
 * - Activity scheduling: What's the maximum number of activities you can attend?
 * - Meeting room allocation: How many meetings can be scheduled in one room?
 * - Resource allocation: Optimal assignment of time-based resources
 * - Task scheduling: Maximize number of non-conflicting tasks
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * 1. Greedy Choice Property: Always select interval with earliest end time
 * 2. Why this works: Early ending intervals leave more room for future selections
 * 3. Mathematical proof: Any optimal solution can be modified to include greedy choice
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Strategy:
 * 1. Sort intervals by end time (ascending order)
 * 2. Greedily select non-overlapping intervals
 * 3. Each selection eliminates all overlapping intervals
 * <p>
 * Common Wrong Approaches:
 * - Select shortest intervals first → Counterexample: [1,100], [2,3], [4,5]
 * - Select earliest start time → Counterexample: [1,100], [2,3], [4,5]
 * - Select intervals with fewest conflicts → Complex to compute and still wrong
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for selection = O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input storage
 * <p>
 * This problem perfectly demonstrates greedy choice property and serves as
 * a foundation for many other interval-based optimization problems.
