/**
 * GAS STATION PROBLEM - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY AND COMPARISON
 * LeetCode 134: Gas Station
 * <p>
 * Problem Evolution: From O(n²) Brute Force to O(n) Optimal Solutions
 * <p>
 * APPROACH SUMMARY:
 * <p>
 * 1. BRUTE FORCE APPROACH:
 * - Try each station as starting point, simulate full journey
 * - Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)
 * - Straightforward but inefficient due to redundant calculations
 * <p>
 * 2. MATHEMATICAL GRAPH APPROACH:
 * - Transform to cumulative sum graph analysis
 * - Find minimum point, start from next station for maximum "lift"
 * - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
 * - Elegant mathematical insight with visual interpretation
 * <p>
 * 3. GREEDY ELIMINATION APPROACH:
 * - Use failure patterns to eliminate multiple candidates at once
 * - Key insight: if start i fails at j, then i+1,...,j-1 also fail at j
 * - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
 * - Efficient elimination strategy based on problem structure
 * <p>
 * CORE INSIGHTS:
 * - All algorithms essentially solve the same mathematical problem
 * - Graph approach focuses on "translation/shifting" perspective
 * - Greedy approach focuses on "elimination/pruning" perspective
 * - Both optimal approaches avoid redundant computation from brute force
 * <p>
 * ALGORITHM EQUIVALENCE:
 * The graph and greedy approaches are mathematically equivalent:
 * - Graph finds argmin(cumulative_sum) + 1
 * - Greedy eliminates stations until finding the same starting point
 * - Both guaranteed to find the unique solution (if exists)
 * <p>
 * PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
 * - Resource allocation with circular constraints
 * - Route planning with fuel/cost considerations
 * - Optimization problems with cyclic dependencies
 * - Any scenario requiring optimal starting point in circular systems
