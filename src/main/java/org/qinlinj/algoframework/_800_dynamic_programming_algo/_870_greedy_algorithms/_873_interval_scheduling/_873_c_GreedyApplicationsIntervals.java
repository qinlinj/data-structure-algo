/**
 * GREEDY ALGORITHM APPLICATIONS - INTERVAL PROBLEMS
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates three related interval problems that showcase
 * how the core interval scheduling algorithm can be adapted for different scenarios:
 * <p>
 * 1. NON-OVERLAPPING INTERVALS (LeetCode 435):
 * - Problem: Remove minimum intervals to make all remaining non-overlapping
 * - Insight: Total intervals - Maximum non-overlapping intervals
 * - Greedy choice: Same as interval scheduling (earliest end time)
 * <p>
 * 2. MINIMUM ARROWS TO BURST BALLOONS (LeetCode 452):
 * - Problem: Minimum arrows needed to burst all balloon intervals
 * - Insight: Each arrow can burst overlapping balloons at intersection
 * - Greedy choice: Shoot at earliest end point of overlapping group
 * - Key difference: Touching boundaries count as overlapping
 * <p>
 * 3. MEETING ROOMS VARIATIONS:
 * - Problem: Various meeting room scheduling scenarios
 * - Applications: Resource allocation, task scheduling, time management
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Adaptations:
 * - Core strategy remains: sort by end time, make greedy choices
 * - Modifications: Adjust overlap definition, counting mechanism
 * - Complexity: All maintain O(n log n) time due to sorting
 * <p>
 * Key Learning Points:
 * 1. Same underlying greedy principle applies to multiple problems
 * 2. Small modifications adapt algorithm to different requirements
 * 3. Understanding core algorithm enables solving related problems
 * 4. Greedy choice property transfers across similar problem structures
 * <p>
 * Real-world Applications:
 * - Project management: Task scheduling with dependencies
 * - Resource allocation: Equipment, rooms, personnel scheduling
 * - Entertainment: TV program scheduling, event planning
 * - Manufacturing: Production line optimization, machine scheduling
