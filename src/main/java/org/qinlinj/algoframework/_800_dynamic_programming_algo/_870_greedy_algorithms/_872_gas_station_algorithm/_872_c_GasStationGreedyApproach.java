/**
 * GAS STATION PROBLEM - GREEDY ALGORITHM APPROACH
 * <p>
 * Core Greedy Insight:
 * If starting from station i, we can't reach station j, then no station between i and j
 * (inclusive of i, exclusive of j) can be a valid starting point.
 * <p>
 * Mathematical Reasoning:
 * - If from station i (tank=0) we reach station k with tank>0, but can't reach station j
 * - Then starting from station k (tank=0) definitely can't reach station j
 * - Because we had positive fuel when reaching k from i, but still failed
 * - Starting with tank=0 at k gives us even less fuel, so definitely will fail
 * <p>
 * Greedy Strategy:
 * 1. Try starting from station 0, simulate journey
 * 2. When we first encounter tank<0 at station j, we know:
 * - Stations 0 through current station can't be starting points
 * - The next valid candidate is station j+1
 * 3. Reset tank to 0 and continue from station j+1
 * 4. This eliminates multiple stations at once, reducing redundant calculations
 * <p>
 * Key Properties:
 * - Single pass through array: O(n) time complexity
 * - Constant extra space: O(1) space complexity
 * - Eliminates redundant computations from brute force approach
 * - Each station is visited at most twice (once in each direction)
 * <p>
 * Correctness Proof:
 * - Greedy choice eliminates impossible starting points efficiently
 * - If total gas >= total cost, solution exists and will be found
 * - The algorithm naturally finds the optimal starting point
 * <p>
 * Comparison with Graph Approach:
 * - Same time/space complexity as mathematical graph method
 * - Different conceptual framework but equivalent results
 * - Greedy focuses on elimination, graph focuses on translation
 * - Both reveal hidden structure to avoid O(nÂ²) brute force
