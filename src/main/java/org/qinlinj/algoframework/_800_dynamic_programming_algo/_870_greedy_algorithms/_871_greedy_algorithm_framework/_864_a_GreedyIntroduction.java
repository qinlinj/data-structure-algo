/**
 * GREEDY ALGORITHM INTRODUCTION - BASIC EXAMPLE
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Greedy Algorithm Definition: Makes locally optimal choices at each step
 * 2. Algorithm Evolution: From brute force O(2^n) to optimized O(1)
 * 3. Core Principle: All algorithms are essentially exhaustive search with optimizations
 * 4. Problem: Given unlimited 1-yuan and 100-yuan bills, choose 10 bills to maximize total value
 * 5. Solution Evolution:
 * - Brute Force: Enumerate all 2^10 = 1024 possibilities
 * - Optimization 1: Recognize 100 > 1, always choose 100-yuan bills
 * - Optimization 2: Convert recursion to iteration
 * - Optimization 3: Direct calculation
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity Evolution: O(2^n) → O(n) → O(1)
 * <p>
 * This demonstrates how greedy algorithms can dramatically improve efficiency
 * when the problem has greedy choice property.
