/**
 * COMPLETE DUNGEON GAME SOLUTION WITH COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
 * <p>
 * Problem Summary:
 * - Knight must travel from top-left to bottom-right to rescue princess
 * - Can only move right or down
 * - Health must remain > 0 throughout the journey
 * - Find minimum initial health required
 * <p>
 * Solution Approach:
 * 1. Use reverse DP: work backwards from destination
 * 2. dp(i,j) = minimum health needed at (i,j) to reach the end successfully
 * 3. State transition: dp(i,j) = max(1, min(dp(i+1,j), dp(i,j+1)) - grid[i][j])
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m,n are grid dimensions
 * Space Complexity: O(m*n) for memoization
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * - Forward DP fails due to insufficient state information
 * - Reverse DP provides complete information for optimal decisions
 * - Health constraint (>0) is critical for correctness
