 * BFS Algorithm Approach for Cheapest Flights Problem
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. BFS (Breadth-First Search) naturally finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs
 * 2. For weighted graphs, we need Priority Queue (Dijkstra's algorithm) instead of regular queue
 * 3. BFS expands layer by layer from source, guaranteeing shortest path when destination is reached
 * 4. Regular queue works for unweighted graphs because each edge has weight 1
 * 5. Priority queue ensures nodes with smaller path weights are processed first
 * <p>
 * Problem Context:
 * - Find cheapest flight path from source to destination
 * - Maximum K intermediate stops allowed
 * - This is a weighted directed graph shortest path problem
 * <p>
 * Why Priority Queue is needed:
 * - In weighted graphs, fewer edges doesn't guarantee smaller total weight
 * - Some paths may have few edges but high individual weights
 * - Priority queue automatically sorts by path weight, not edge count
