/**
 * PIANO FINGERING OPTIMIZATION ANALOGY
 * <p>
 * Key Insights from Piano Practice:
 * 1. State: Current finger positions + next note to play
 * 2. Choice: Which finger to use for the next note
 * 3. Cost Function: "Awkwardness" of finger transitions
 * 4. Goal: Minimize total awkwardness for smooth performance
 * <p>
 * Parallels to Freedom Trail Problem:
 * - Piano keys ↔ Ring characters
 * - Finger positions ↔ Pointer position
 * - Note sequence ↔ Key string to spell
 * - Finger transitions ↔ Ring rotations
 * - Awkwardness cost ↔ Rotation cost
 * <p>
 * DP State Design Lessons:
 * - State must capture current position and remaining task
 * - Choices are the possible ways to handle next element
 * - Cost functions can be customized based on constraints
 * - Global optimization requires considering entire sequence
