/**
 * COMPLETE FREEDOM TRAIL SOLUTION WITH COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
 * <p>
 * Problem: Given a circular ring of characters and a key string,
 * find minimum operations to spell the key by rotating ring and pressing button.
 * <p>
 * Solution Approach:
 * 1. DP State: (current_ring_position, current_key_index)
 * 2. Transition: For each occurrence of key[j], try both rotation directions
 * 3. Cost: rotation_steps + 1 (button press) + future_cost
 * 4. Optimization: Memoization to avoid recomputing same states
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * - Multiple occurrences of same character create choice points
 * - Must consider global optimization, not just local minimum distance
 * - Circular nature means rotation can go both clockwise/counterclockwise
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(ring.length × key.length × avg_char_occurrences)
 * Space Complexity: O(ring.length × key.length) for memoization
 * <p>
 * LeetCode 514: Freedom Trail (Hard)
