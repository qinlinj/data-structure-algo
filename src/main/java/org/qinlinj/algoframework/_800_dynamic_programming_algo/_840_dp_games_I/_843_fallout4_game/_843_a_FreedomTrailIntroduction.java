/**
 * FREEDOM TRAIL PROBLEM INTRODUCTION
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Circular dial with characters arranged in a ring
 * 2. Pointer initially points to 12 o'clock position (ring[0])
 * 3. Can rotate dial clockwise or counterclockwise
 * 4. Need to spell out a target string by rotating and pressing button
 * 5. Goal: Find minimum operations to input the entire key string
 * <p>
 * Operations:
 * - Rotate dial one position: 1 operation
 * - Press center button: 1 operation
 * <p>
 * Problem Analysis:
 * - Multiple occurrences of same character create choices
 * - Need to consider global optimization, not just local minimum
 * - Classic dynamic programming problem for finding optimal sequence
 * <p>
 * Real-world Connection:
 * - Similar to combination locks, rotary phones, piano fingering optimization
 * - Demonstrates importance of state-based decision making
