/**
 * WHY MAXIMUM PATH SUM APPROACH IS WRONG
 * <p>
 * Key Learning Points:
 * 1. Intuitive but incorrect approach: maximize health potions collected
 * 2. Maximum path sum â‰  minimum initial health requirement
 * 3. Counterexample shows why this logic fails
 * 4. Focus should be on minimizing health loss, not maximizing gain
 * <p>
 * Important Insight:
 * - Getting the most health potions doesn't guarantee minimum initial health
 * - The timing and sequence of health changes matter more than total gain
 * - Need to consider worst-case scenarios along different paths
 * <p>
 * This demonstrates why careful problem analysis is crucial before coding.
