/**
 * Complete Analysis and Variations of Cheapest Flights Problem
 * <p>
 * Comprehensive Coverage:
 * 1. Multiple Solution Approaches: BFS/Dijkstra, Top-down DP, Bottom-up DP, Bellman-Ford
 * 2. Problem Variations: Exact K stops, At most K stops, Multiple destinations
 * 3. Edge Cases: No path exists, Self-loops, Multiple edges between cities
 * 4. Optimization Techniques: Early termination, Space optimization, Pruning
 * 5. Real-world Applications: Flight booking, Network routing, Cost optimization
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Comparison:
 * - Dijkstra: O((V+E)logV), good for sparse graphs, handles general shortest path
 * - Top-down DP: O(V*K*E), intuitive recursion, handles step constraints naturally
 * - Bottom-up DP: O(K*E), iterative, better space locality, easier to optimize
 * - Bellman-Ford: O(K*E), detects negative cycles, works with negative weights
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a complete reference implementation with extensive testing
 * and real-world scenario simulation for the cheapest flights problem.
