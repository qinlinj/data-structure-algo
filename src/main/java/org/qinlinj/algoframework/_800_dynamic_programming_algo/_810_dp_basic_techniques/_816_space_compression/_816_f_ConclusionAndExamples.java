/**
 * Conclusion and Additional Examples of Space Optimization
 * <p>
 * Summary:
 * - Space optimization is a powerful technique to reduce memory usage in dynamic programming solutions
 * <p>
 * - Key benefits:
 * 1. Reduces space complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for many 2D DP problems
 * 2. Makes solutions viable for problems with very large inputs
 * 3. Can improve cache locality for better performance
 * <p>
 * - Primary applications:
 * 1. Problems where state transitions only depend on adjacent states
 * 2. Scenarios with tight memory constraints
 * 3. Classic DP problems like string matching, path finding, and optimization
 * <p>
 * - Best practices:
 * 1. Start with a clear, correct standard DP solution
 * 2. Analyze the dependencies in the state transition equation
 * 3. Determine if space optimization is necessary and applicable
 * 4. Implement the optimization with careful attention to order and temporary variables
 * 5. Add detailed comments to explain the optimization
 * <p>
 * - While space optimization makes code more complex, it's a valuable tool in a programmer's arsenal
 * for solving large-scale dynamic programming problems efficiently
