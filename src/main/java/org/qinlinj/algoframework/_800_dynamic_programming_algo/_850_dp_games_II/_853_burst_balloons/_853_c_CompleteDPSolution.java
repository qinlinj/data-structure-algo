/**
 * BURST BALLOONS PROBLEM - COMPLETE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING SOLUTION
 * <p>
 * Final Implementation Details:
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Steps:
 * 1. Transform input by adding virtual balloons with value 1 at both ends
 * 2. Initialize DP table: dp[i][j] = max coins from range (i,j) exclusive
 * 3. Fill DP table using bottom-up approach with correct traversal order
 * 4. For each range (i,j), try all possible k as the last balloon to burst
 * 5. Return dp[0][n+1] as the final answer
 * <p>
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * - Time: O(n³) - three nested loops
 * - Space: O(n²) - 2D DP table
 * <p>
 * Key Implementation Details:
 * - Traversal order: i from n to 0, j from i+1 to n+1
 * - State transition: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + points[i]*points[k]*points[j])
 * - Base cases are automatically handled (dp[i][j] = 0 when no balloons between i and j)
 * <p>
 * Example Trace:
 * Input: [3,1,5,8] → Enhanced: [1,3,1,5,8,1]
 * Final answer: dp[0][5] = 167
