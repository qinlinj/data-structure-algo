/**
 * STONE GAME - COMPLETE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IMPLEMENTATION
 * <p>
 * Final Complete Solution:
 * This class provides the full implementation of the Stone Game problem using
 * dynamic programming with optimal game theory strategy.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm Steps:
 * 1. Create 2D DP table to store GameState objects
 * 2. Initialize base cases (single pile games)
 * 3. Fill DP table using bottom-up approach
 * 4. Apply state transition equations for optimal play
 * 5. Extract final answer from dp[0][n-1]
 * <p>
 * Implementation Details:
 * - Use custom Pair class to store both players' scores
 * - Traverse DP table in correct order (smaller ranges first)
 * - Handle base cases and general cases separately
 * - Ensure both players play optimally at each step
 * <p>
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * - Time: O(n²) - fill n² DP states, each in O(1) time
 * - Space: O(n²) - store n² Pair objects
 * - Can be optimized to O(n) space but loses clarity
 * <p>
 * Applications:
 * - LeetCode 486: Predict the Winner
 * - LeetCode 877: Stone Game
 * - General minimax game problems
 * - Any two-player zero-sum game with perfect information
 * <p>
 * Key Features:
 * - Handles any array size and values
 * - Guarantees optimal play for both players
 * - Returns exact score difference
 * - Easily adaptable to similar problems
