/**
 * STONE GAME PROBLEM - INTRODUCTION AND GAME THEORY ANALYSIS
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * - Two players face a row of stone piles represented by array piles[]
 * - Players take turns picking from either end (leftmost or rightmost pile)
 * - Each player wants to maximize their total stones
 * - Both players play optimally (make the best possible moves)
 * - Goal: Determine the score difference between first and second player
 * <p>
 * Game Theory Concepts:
 * 1. Perfect Information Game: Both players know all available moves
 * 2. Zero-Sum Game: One player's gain equals the other's loss
 * 3. Optimal Strategy: Each player makes moves to maximize their advantage
 * 4. Minimax Principle: Maximize your gain while minimizing opponent's gain
 * <p>
 * Key Insight:
 * - This is a generalized version of LeetCode 877 (Stone Game)
 * - Unlike the original where first player always wins, this version can have any outcome
 * - Example: [1, 100, 3] - second player wins by taking 100
 * <p>
 * Related Problems:
 * - LeetCode 486: Predict the Winner
 * - LeetCode 877: Stone Game
 * - General game theory problems with optimal play
 * <p>
 * Solution Approach:
 * - Use Dynamic Programming with game state representation
 * - Track both players' optimal scores simultaneously
 * - Consider all possible moves and their consequences
