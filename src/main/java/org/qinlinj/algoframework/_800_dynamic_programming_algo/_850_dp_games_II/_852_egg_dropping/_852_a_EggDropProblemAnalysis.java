/**
 * EGG DROPPING PROBLEM - PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * Given K eggs and N floors, find the minimum number of trials needed in the worst case
 * to determine the critical floor F where eggs break. Floor F satisfies:
 * - Eggs thrown from floors <= F will NOT break
 * - Eggs thrown from floors > F WILL break
 * - If an egg doesn't break, it can be reused
 * <p>
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * 1. WORST CASE: The scenario that requires maximum trials before finding F
 * 2. MINIMUM TRIALS: The optimal strategy that minimizes worst-case trials
 * 3. STRATEGY CONSTRAINTS: Limited eggs affect available strategies
 * <p>
 * STRATEGY ANALYSIS:
 * 1. Linear Search: Try floors 1, 2, 3... sequentially
 * - Works with 1 egg, worst case = N trials
 * 2. Binary Search: Divide search space in half each time
 * - Requires multiple eggs, worst case = log(N) trials
 * 3. Hybrid Strategies: Combination approaches for limited eggs
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLES:
 * - 1 egg, 7 floors: Must use linear search → 7 trials worst case
 * - Unlimited eggs, 7 floors: Binary search → 3 trials worst case
 * - 2 eggs, 100 floors: Hybrid strategy needed → 14 trials optimal
 * <p>
 * COMPLEXITY FACTORS:
 * - Egg count K determines available strategies
 * - Floor count N affects search space
 * - Trade-off between risk (breaking eggs) and efficiency
