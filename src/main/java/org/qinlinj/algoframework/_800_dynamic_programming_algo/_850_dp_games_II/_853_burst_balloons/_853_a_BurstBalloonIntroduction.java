/**
 * BURST BALLOON PROBLEM - INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM ANALYSIS
 * <p>
 * This is LeetCode Problem 312: Burst Balloons (Hard difficulty)
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 * - Given n balloons numbered 0 to n-1, each with a number on it (stored in nums array)
 * - When you burst balloon i, you get nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1] coins
 * - If i-1 or i+1 is out of bounds, treat it as a balloon with value 1
 * - Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting all balloons
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
 * Output: 167
 * Explanation: [3,1,5,8] → [3,5,8] → [3,8] → [8] → []
 * Coins: 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 15 + 120 + 24 + 8 = 167
 * <p>
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * 1. This is a classic optimization problem requiring finding maximum value
 * 2. Two main approaches: Backtracking (brute force) and Dynamic Programming
 * 3. The challenge is handling dependencies between adjacent balloons
 * 4. Requires clever DP state definition to avoid subproblem interference
