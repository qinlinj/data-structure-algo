/**
 * EGG DROPPING PROBLEM - FURTHER OPTIMIZATIONS
 * <p>
 * ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
 * Building on the state redefinition approach, we can achieve even better complexity:
 * <p>
 * 1. BINARY SEARCH ON TRIALS:
 * Since dp[K][m] is monotonically increasing in m, we can binary search
 * to find the minimum m such that dp[K][m] >= N
 * Time complexity: O(K * log N)
 * <p>
 * 2. MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
 * The recurrence relation dp[k][m] = dp[k-1][m-1] + dp[k][m-1] + 1
 * has a closed-form solution related to binomial coefficients
 * Time complexity: O(K * log N), Space: O(1)
 * <p>
 * 3. SPACE OPTIMIZATION:
 * Since we only need previous row and column, space can be reduced to O(K)
 * <p>
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - Monotonicity properties enable binary search optimizations
 * - Mathematical patterns can replace iterative computation
 * - Space-time tradeoffs allow further optimization
 * - Practical vs theoretical optimality considerations
 * <p>
 * COMPLEXITY EVOLUTION:
 * Basic DP: O(K*N²) → Binary Opt: O(K*N*logN) → State Redef: O(K*N) → Final: O(K*logN)
