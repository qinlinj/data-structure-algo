/**
 * Introduction to the Relationship Between Backtracking and Dynamic Programming
 * <p>
 * Key Points:
 * - Backtracking and dynamic programming are both recursive approaches to problem-solving
 * - They appear similar in structure but serve different purposes
 * - Backtracking is a brute force approach that explores all possible solutions
 * - Dynamic programming optimizes recursive solutions by eliminating overlapping subproblems
 * - This class introduces LeetCode problem 494 "Target Sum" which can be solved using both methods
 * - The problem asks to count ways to add '+' or '-' before each number to reach a target sum
