     * Two-Dimensional DP Template for Subsequence Problems
     * <p>
     * Key Concepts:
     * 1. The two-dimensional DP template uses a matrix where each cell represents
     * the optimal solution for a specific range or pair of indices.
     * 2. This approach is typically used for:
     * - Problems involving two sequences (like Longest Common Subsequence)
     * - Problems involving ranges in a single sequence (like Longest Palindromic Subsequence)
     * 3. For two sequences, dp[i][j] typically represents the solution for the prefixes
     * ending at indices i and j of the respective sequences.
     * 4. For ranges in a single sequence, dp[i][j] typically represents the solution
     * for the subsequence from index i to j.
     * 5. Time and space complexity are generally O(nÂ²).
     * <p>
     * This class introduces the two-dimensional DP template with examples.
