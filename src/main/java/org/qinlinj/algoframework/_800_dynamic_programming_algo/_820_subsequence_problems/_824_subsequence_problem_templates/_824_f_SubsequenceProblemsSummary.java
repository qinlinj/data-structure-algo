/**
 * Summary and Comparison of Subsequence Problem Patterns
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive summary of the patterns and techniques we've explored
 * for solving subsequence problems using dynamic programming.
 * <p>
 * Key Takeaways:
 * 1. Subsequence problems typically fall into two categories:
 * - Single sequence problems (like LIS) - often use 1D DP arrays
 * - Two sequence problems (like LCS) or range problems (like LPS) - often use 2D DP arrays
 * <p>
 * 2. The critical step is defining the DP state appropriately:
 * - For 1D DP: dp[i] typically represents optimal solution ending at index i
 * - For 2D DP with two sequences: dp[i][j] typically represents optimal solution for
 * prefixes s1[0...i] and s2[0...j]
 * - For 2D DP with ranges: dp[i][j] typically represents optimal solution for
 * the substring s[i...j]
 * <p>
 * 3. Understanding the underlying pattern allows us to:
 * - Recognize which approach to use for new problems
 * - Adapt solutions from one problem to solve related problems
 * <p>
 * This class compares the different approaches and highlights their connections.
