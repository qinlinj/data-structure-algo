/**
 * Summary of Subsequence Problems and Dynamic Programming Patterns
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive summary of the common patterns and techniques
 * used to solve subsequence problems with dynamic programming. It highlights the key insights
 * from the three problems we've explored:
 * <p>
 * 1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) - Finding the longest subsequence common to two strings
 * 2. Delete Operation for Two Strings - Finding minimum deletions to make two strings equal
 * 3. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum - Finding minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters
 * <p>
 * Key Patterns:
 * 1. Two-pointer approach with i and j traversing the two strings
 * 2. Decision-making based on character comparison (match or mismatch)
 * 3. Using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations
 * 4. Careful definition of state and transition functions
 * 5. Choice of top-down (recursive with memoization) or bottom-up (iterative) implementation
 * <p>
 * This pattern-based approach can be applied to many other subsequence problems.
