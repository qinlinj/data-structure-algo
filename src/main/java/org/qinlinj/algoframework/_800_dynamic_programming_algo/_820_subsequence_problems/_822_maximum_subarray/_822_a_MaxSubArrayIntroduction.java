/**
 * Introduction to the Maximum Subarray Problem (LeetCode #53)
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
 * which has the largest sum and return its sum.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [-3,1,3,-1,2,-4,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The subarray [1,3,-1,2] has the largest sum 5.
 * <p>
 * This class introduces the problem and sets up the basic framework. The solution can be
 * approached in multiple ways:
 * 1. Sliding Window
 * 2. Dynamic Programming
 * 3. Prefix Sum
 * <p>
 * Each approach has distinct advantages and illustrates different algorithm design paradigms.
