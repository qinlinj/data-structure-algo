/**
 * ADVANCED DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS SUMMARY
 * <p>
 * This collection demonstrates advanced DP patterns and problem-solving techniques:
 * <p>
 * 1. INTERLEAVING STRING (LeetCode 97)
 * - Pattern: 2D DP with exhaustive choice exploration
 * - Key: When multiple choices available, try all (not greedy)
 * - Technique: Top-down memoization vs bottom-up tabulation
 * - Time: O(m×n), Space: O(m×n)
 * - Challenge: Avoiding greedy mistakes in string matching
 * <p>
 * 2. MAXIMUM PRODUCT SUBARRAY (LeetCode 152)
 * - Pattern: Modified Kadane's algorithm with dual state tracking
 * - Key: Track both maximum AND minimum (negative × negative = positive)
 * - Technique: Handle sign changes and zero values carefully
 * - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) after optimization
 * - Challenge: Negative numbers can turn min into max
 * <p>
 * 3. MAXIMAL SQUARE (LeetCode 221)
 * - Pattern: 2D DP with geometric constraints
 * - Key: Square formation depends on weakest neighbor (bucket effect)
 * - Technique: State represents side length, not area
 * - Time: O(m×n), Space: O(min(m,n)) after optimization
 * - Challenge: Understanding the minimum constraint relationship
 * <p>
 * 4. LONGEST INCREASING PATH IN MATRIX (LeetCode 329)
 * - Pattern: DFS + Memoization on 2D grid
 * - Key: No cycles possible due to strictly increasing constraint
 * - Technique: Exhaustive search with caching, no visited array needed
 * - Time: O(m×n), Space: O(m×n)
 * - Challenge: Recognizing that longest path ≠ shortest path algorithms
 * <p>
 * 5. MAXIMUM PROFIT JOB SCHEDULING (LeetCode 1235)
 * - Pattern: Interval DP with sorting and range queries
 * - Key: Sort by end time to enable clear state definition
 * - Technique: TreeMap for efficient predecessor queries
 * - Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)
 * - Challenge: Choosing optimal data structure for range queries
 * <p>
 * ADVANCED DP TECHNIQUES COVERED:
 * - Dual state tracking (max/min simultaneously)
 * - Exhaustive vs greedy choice exploration
 * - Grid-based DFS with memoization
 * - Interval scheduling with sorting
 * - Geometric constraint handling (squares, rectangles)
 * - String/sequence interleaving problems
 * - Range query optimization with TreeMap/binary search
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM-SOLVING PATTERNS:
 * 1. When to use top-down vs bottom-up approaches
 * 2. How to handle multiple optimal substructure paths
 * 3. Space optimization techniques for 2D problems
 * 4. Choosing appropriate data structures for auxiliary operations
 * 5. Recognizing when greedy approaches fail
 * 6. Converting complex constraints into DP state definitions
