/**
 * FISHER-YATES SHUFFLE ALGORITHM FOR MINESWEEPER GENERATION
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to generate a uniform random
 * distribution of mines in a minesweeper game board. The algorithm ensures that every
 * cell has an equal probability of containing a mine.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Fisher-Yates Shuffle: A classic algorithm for generating random permutations
 * - Creates all possible positions (width × height)
 * - Shuffles them randomly using Fisher-Yates algorithm
 * - Takes first mineCount positions as mine locations
 * <p>
 * 2. Uniform Random Distribution: Every cell has probability P(x) = mineCount/(width×height)
 * <p>
 * 3. Algorithm Steps:
 * - Generate all possible coordinates
 * - Apply Fisher-Yates shuffle to randomize order
 * - Select first mineCount positions as mines
 * <p>
 * 4. Trade-offs:
 * - Time Complexity: O(width × height) - must process all positions
 * - Space Complexity: O(width × height) - stores all positions
 * - Advantage: Simple and guaranteed uniform distribution
 * - Disadvantage: High memory usage for large boards
 * <p>
 * Applications: Small to medium sized minesweeper boards where memory is not a constraint
