/**
 * COMPLETE MINESWEEPER GAME IMPLEMENTATION
 * <p>
 * This class provides a complete, playable minesweeper game that demonstrates
 * the practical application of random mine generation algorithms. It combines
 * the theoretical concepts with an interactive gaming experience.
 * <p>
 * Key Features:
 * 1. Multiple Mine Generation Strategies:
 * - Fisher-Yates Shuffle for small-medium boards
 * - Reservoir Sampling for large boards with memory efficiency
 * - User can choose generation algorithm
 * <p>
 * 2. Complete Game Logic:
 * - Cell revelation and flagging
 * - Mine counting for numbered cells
 * - Flood fill for empty cell clusters
 * - Win/lose condition detection
 * <p>
 * 3. Interactive Console Interface:
 * - Command-based gameplay (reveal, flag, unflag)
 * - Visual board display with symbols
 * - Game state feedback and statistics
 * <p>
 * 4. Educational Demonstrations:
 * - Algorithm performance comparison
 * - Mine distribution visualization
 * - Statistical analysis of randomness
 * <p>
 * Game Rules:
 * - Reveal cells to find all non-mine cells
 * - Numbers indicate adjacent mine count
 * - Flag suspected mines
 * - Game ends when all non-mines revealed or mine hit
 * <p>
 * Applications: Educational tool, algorithm demonstration, recreational gaming
