 * MONTE CARLO VERIFICATION FOR RANDOM GAME ALGORITHMS
 * <p>
 * This class implements Monte Carlo simulation methods to verify the correctness
 * and uniformity of random algorithms used in game development. It provides
 * statistical validation tools to ensure random algorithms work as expected.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Monte Carlo Method: Statistical technique using repeated random sampling
 * - Run algorithm many times with same parameters
 * - Collect frequency statistics of outcomes
 * - Compare against theoretical expectations
 * <p>
 * 2. Uniformity Testing: Verify each outcome has equal probability
 * - Chi-square goodness of fit test
 * - Standard deviation analysis
 * - Visual distribution analysis
 * <p>
 * 3. Applications:
 * - Validate shuffle algorithms (Fisher-Yates)
 * - Verify sampling algorithms (Reservoir Sampling)
 * - Test random number generators
 * - Quality assurance for game randomness
 * <p>
 * 4. Statistical Measures:
 * - Expected frequency: trials / possible_outcomes
 * - Standard deviation: sqrt(expected * (1 - probability))
 * - Chi-square statistic: Σ((observed - expected)² / expected)
 * - Confidence intervals and p-values
 * <p>
 * 5. Practical Examples:
 * - Calculate π using random points in circle
 * - Verify card shuffle fairness
 * - Test mine placement uniformity
 * - Validate loot drop probabilities
 * <p>
 * 6. LeetCode Judge System: How platforms detect randomness bugs
 * - Run algorithm thousands of times
 * - Statistical analysis of results
 * - Detect non-uniform distributions
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(trials × algorithm_complexity)
 * Space Complexity: O(outcomes) for frequency tracking
