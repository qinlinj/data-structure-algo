/**
 * RESERVOIR SAMPLING ALGORITHM FOR MINESWEEPER GENERATION
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Reservoir Sampling algorithm to generate mine positions
 * for minesweeper with optimal space complexity, especially suitable for large boards.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Reservoir Sampling: Algorithm for selecting k random samples from a stream of n items
 * where n is very large or unknown, using only O(k) space complexity
 * <p>
 * 2. Algorithm Steps:
 * - Fill reservoir with first k items
 * - For each subsequent item i (i > k):
 * * Generate random number r in range [0, i]
 * * If r < k, replace reservoir[r] with current item
 * <p>
 * 3. Mathematical Proof of Uniformity:
 * - Each item has probability k/n of being selected
 * - Probability that item i is in final reservoir = k/n
 * - Maintains uniform distribution throughout the process
 * <p>
 * 4. Advantages:
 * - Space Complexity: O(mineCount) instead of O(width × height)
 * - Works with arbitrarily large boards
 * - Still maintains uniform random distribution
 * - Processes positions in streaming fashion
 * <p>
 * 5. Trade-offs:
 * - Time Complexity: O(width × height) - must examine all positions
 * - More complex than Fisher-Yates shuffle
 * - Requires understanding of probabilistic algorithms
 * <p>
 * Applications: Large minesweeper boards where memory efficiency is critical
