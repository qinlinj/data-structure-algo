/**
 * FACTORIAL TRAILING ZEROS - MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS AND THEORY
 * <p>
 * FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS:
 * 1. Trailing zeros in factorials come from factors of 10 = 2 Ã— 5
 * 2. In factorials, factors of 2 are more abundant than factors of 5
 * 3. The number of trailing zeros = number of times 10 divides n!
 * 4. This equals the number of pairs (2,5) in the prime factorization
 * <p>
 * KEY MATHEMATICAL INSIGHTS:
 * 1. Every even number contributes at least one factor of 2
 * 2. Every 5th number contributes at least one factor of 5
 * 3. Some numbers contribute multiple factors of 5 (25, 125, etc.)
 * 4. The trailingZeroes function is monotonically non-decreasing
 * <p>
 * APPLICATIONS:
 * - LeetCode 172: Count trailing zeros in n!
 * - LeetCode 793: Count how many n give exactly K trailing zeros
 * - Mathematical analysis of factorial properties
 * - Understanding binary search on functions
 * <p>
 * TIME COMPLEXITIES:
 * - Counting trailing zeros: O(log n)
 * - Finding preimage size: O(log K)
