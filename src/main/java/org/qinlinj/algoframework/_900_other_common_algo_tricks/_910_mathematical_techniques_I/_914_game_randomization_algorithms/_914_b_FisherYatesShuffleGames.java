/**
 * FISHER-YATES SHUFFLE ALGORITHM FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm specifically for game development
 * scenarios, demonstrating how to solve the "select k different random elements" problem
 * by transforming it into "shuffle array and take first k elements".
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Problem Transformation: Instead of selecting k random elements (with duplicate handling),
 * place k elements at start of array, then shuffle entire array randomly
 * <p>
 * 2. Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm:
 * - For each position i from 0 to n-1:
 * * Generate random index r in range [i, n-1]
 * * Swap elements at positions i and r
 * - Guarantees each permutation has equal probability (1/n!)
 * <p>
 * 3. Mathematical Correctness:
 * - Algorithm produces all n! possible permutations
 * - Each element has equal probability of ending up at any position
 * - Proof: Position 0 has n choices, position 1 has (n-1) choices, etc.
 * <p>
 * 4. Applications in Game Development:
 * - Minesweeper: Random mine placement
 * - Card games: Deck shuffling
 * - RPGs: Random loot distribution
 * - Puzzle games: Level generation
 * <p>
 * 5. Advantages:
 * - Simple implementation
 * - Guaranteed uniform distribution
 * - O(n) time complexity
 * - Well-established algorithm with proven properties
 * <p>
 * 6. Trade-offs:
 * - Requires O(n) space for full array
 * - Must process all elements even if k << n
 * - Not suitable for very large search spaces
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n) for shuffling n elements
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for storing all elements
