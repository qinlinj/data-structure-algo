/**
 * Exam Room Problem Analysis
 * <p>
 * This class discusses the core ideas and concepts needed to solve the Exam Room problem.
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * <p>
 * 1. Segment Abstraction:
 * - We can think of the exam room as a series of segments between seated students
 * - Each new student should be placed at the midpoint of the longest segment
 * - When a student leaves, two adjacent segments merge into one
 * <p>
 * 2. Data Structure Selection:
 * - We need a data structure that can:
 * a) Find the longest segment quickly
 * b) Add and remove segments efficiently
 * c) Track relationships between segments and seats
 * - The problem requires extracting the maximum segment, but also deleting arbitrary segments
 * - Binary heap (priority queue) can find the max/min quickly but can't delete arbitrary elements efficiently
 * - Balanced binary search tree (TreeSet) can do both operations in O(log N) time
 * <p>
 * 3. TreeSet vs HashSet:
 * - HashSet has O(1) operations but no ordering
 * - TreeSet maintains elements in order and has O(log N) operations
 * - For this problem, we need the ordering property of TreeSet
 * <p>
 * 4. Simplification Strategy:
 * - We'll start by solving a simplified version that ignores the "lowest index" requirement
 * - Then adapt our solution to handle this additional constraint
