 * ANALYSIS OF AN INCORRECT APPROACH TO THE MEDIAN FINDER PROBLEM
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates a seemingly logical but incorrect implementation of the MedianFinder.
 * <p>
 * The Incorrect Approach:
 * The intuitive approach might be to simply add elements to either heap based on their relative
 * sizes, without any additional balancing mechanism:
 * - If small has more or equal elements than large, add to large
 * - Otherwise, add to small
 * <p>
 * Problem with this approach:
 * While this maintains the size balance between heaps, it fails to maintain the crucial property
 * that every element in large must be greater than or equal to every element in small.
 * <p>
 * Example of Failure:
 * 1. Add 1: It goes to large (since both heaps are empty)
 * 2. Add 2: It goes to small (since large has more elements)
 * 3. Add 3: It goes to large (since both heaps have equal elements)
 * <p>
 * At this point:
 * - large contains [1, 3]
 * - small contains [2]
 * <p>
 * When we call findMedian(), we expect 2, but the actual computation would give (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
 * This is incorrect because large's smallest element (1) is smaller than small's largest element (2)
 * <p>
 * The key insight is that we need to maintain both:
 * 1. Size balance
 * 2. Heap property (large's smallest â‰¥ small's largest)
