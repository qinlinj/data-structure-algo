/**
 * Twitter System Summary and Explanation
 * <p>
 * This class provides a summary of the LeetCode 355 problem "Design Twitter"
 * and explains the key concepts and learning points.
 * <p>
 * Key Takeaways from this Problem:
 * <p>
 * 1. Object-Oriented Design
 * - Proper class decomposition with Twitter, User, and Tweet classes
 * - Encapsulation of behavior within appropriate classes
 * - Use of static inner classes to organize related components
 * <p>
 * 2. Data Structures
 * - HashMap for O(1) user lookup
 * - HashSet for efficient following/unfollowing and containment checks
 * - Linked lists to store user tweets in chronological order
 * - Priority queue to merge multiple sorted tweet lists
 * <p>
 * 3. Algorithms
 * - The "merge k sorted lists" algorithm implemented with a priority queue
 * - Time complexity optimization by using appropriate data structures
 * <p>
 * 4. Edge Case Handling
 * - Dealing with non-existent users
 * - Preventing users from unfollowing themselves
 * - Handling empty tweet lists
 * <p>
 * This problem demonstrates how data structures and algorithms are applied
 * to real-world applications, combining theoretical concepts with practical
 * software design principles.
