 * DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE CORRECT APPROACH
 * <p>
 * This class provides a detailed explanation of why the correct two-heap approach works
 * and how it maintains both of our critical invariants:
 * 1. Size balance between heaps (difference of at most 1)
 * 2. Heap property (every element in large â‰¥ every element in small)
 * <p>
 * Key Technique:
 * The correct approach uses an indirect insertion strategy:
 * - To add to large: First add to small, then move small's max to large
 * - To add to small: First add to large, then move large's min to small
 * <p>
 * This ensures that elements are correctly "filtered" through the opposing heap
 * before being placed in their final heap, maintaining our heap property.
 * <p>
 * For every element being added:
 * - If we want it in large, we first offer it to small, then transfer small's maximum to large
 * - If we want it in small, we first offer it to large, then transfer large's minimum to small
 * <p>
 * This crossover technique ensures that:
 * - small always contains the smaller half of the elements
 * - large always contains the larger half of the elements
