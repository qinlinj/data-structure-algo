/**
 * Exam Room Summary and Analysis
 * <p>
 * This class summarizes the key aspects of the LeetCode 855 Exam Room problem solution
 * and provides analysis of time/space complexity and alternative approaches.
 * <p>
 * Problem Summary:
 * - We need to efficiently manage seat assignments in an exam room
 * - Each new student should maximize distance from closest neighbor
 * - If multiple positions have same distance, choose lowest index
 * - Students can leave at any time
 * <p>
 * Solution Approach:
 * - Model the room as segments between seated students
 * - Use TreeSet for efficient segment management
 * - Use HashMaps to track segment relationships
 * - Calculate segment "value" based on distance and position
 * <p>
 * Time & Space Complexity:
 * - Time: O(log N) for both seat() and leave() operations
 * - Space: O(N) for storing segments and mappings
 * <p>
 * Alternative Approaches:
 * - Using a List to store occupied seats - simpler but less efficient (O(N) operations)
 * - Using a Priority Queue - efficient for finding max but not for removals
 * <p>
 * This problem demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate data structures
 * and the value of properly modeling a problem before implementation.
