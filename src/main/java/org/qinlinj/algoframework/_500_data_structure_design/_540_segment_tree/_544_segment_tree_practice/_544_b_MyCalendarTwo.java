 * LeetCode 731: My Calendar II
 * <p>
 * Problem Description:
 * Implement a calendar system that allows booking time intervals with at most double booking.
 * That is, a new booking is allowed if it would create at most a double-booking,
 * but must be rejected if it would create a triple booking.
 * <p>
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Overlapping Interval Counting - Tracking the number of overlapping bookings at each time point
 * 2. Segment Tree with Range Updates - Using a max segment tree to track the maximum number of
 * bookings in any given interval
 * 3. Double Booking vs. Triple Booking - Allowing up to 2 overlapping bookings, but rejecting if it
 * would create 3 or more
 * <p>
 * Solution Approaches:
 * 1. Segment Tree: O(log N) time for both queries and updates
 * - Create a max segment tree that tracks the maximum number of bookings in any interval
 * - For each new booking, check if adding it would cause any interval to have more than 2 bookings
 * - If not, update the segment tree for that interval
 * <p>
 * 2. Two Lists Approach: O(NÂ²) time complexity where N is the number of bookings
 * - Maintain two lists: one for all bookings and one for overlapping intervals
 * - For each new booking, check if it overlaps with any interval in the "overlap" list
 * - If yes, reject it as it would create a triple booking
 * - If not, check for overlaps with the "bookings" list and add any overlaps to the "overlap" list
 * <p>
 * The segment tree approach is more efficient and scalable for larger inputs.
