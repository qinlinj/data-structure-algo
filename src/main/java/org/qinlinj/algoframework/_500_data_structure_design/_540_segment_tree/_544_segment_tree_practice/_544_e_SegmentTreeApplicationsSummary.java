/**
 * Segment Tree Applications Summary
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive overview of segment tree applications
 * in solving interval-based problems, focusing on the calendar scheduling and
 * falling squares problems shown in the previous implementations.
 * <p>
 * Key Insights:
 * <p>
 * 1. Segment Trees for Interval Problems
 * - Segment trees excel at problems involving range queries and updates
 * - They provide O(log N) time complexity for both operations
 * - Dynamic segment trees with lazy propagation optimize memory usage for sparse data
 * <p>
 * 2. Calendar Scheduling Problems
 * - MyCalendar I: Basic interval overlap detection (no triple bookings)
 * - MyCalendar II: Allowing double bookings but rejecting triple bookings
 * - MyCalendar III: Tracking the maximum number of concurrent bookings
 * - All three problems demonstrate the power of segment trees for interval management
 * <p>
 * 3. Falling Squares Problem
 * - Illustrates segment trees for non-calendar interval problems
 * - Shows how to track maximum heights in ranges and update them efficiently
 * - Demonstrates the concept of range maximum query
 * <p>
 * 4. Implementation Approaches
 * - Segment Tree with Array: More memory-efficient, but less flexible
 * - Segment Tree with Nodes: More intuitive and better for dynamic allocation
 * - AllInOneSegmentTree: Comprehensive implementation supporting various operations
 * <p>
 * 5. Comparison with Alternative Approaches
 * - TreeMap: Good for sparse intervals but O(N log N) time complexity
 * - Boundary Count: Simple but less efficient for multiple queries
 * - Brute Force: Intuitive but scales poorly with O(N²) complexity
 * <p>
 * These problems showcase how segment trees provide an elegant and efficient
 * solution for complex interval-based problems in competitive programming.
